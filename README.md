This readme file briefly describes what each python file does.
A more in-depth specification can be found in the coursework specification pdf.
1) q1.py has two functions hash_quadratic which is a quadratic probing hash function and hash_double which is a double hashing function.
2) q1test.py provides test functions and inputs to both functions in q1.py.
3) q2.py has the function count_ephemeral(n1,n2,k) which counts the k-ephemeral numbers i, n1 =< i < n2.
4) q2test.py provides test functions and inputs to the count_ephemeral(n1,n2,k) function in q2.py.
5) q3.py has the function good_expression(sape) that takes a basic mathematical expression (including brackets, +, -, *)
   and returns a boolean True if there are no redundant brackets and a boolean False otherwise.
6) q6a.py and q6c.py have the recursive function RMergeSelectionHybrid(listm) that takes a list of numbers as input
   and merge sorts the list if it has more than 4 elements and selection sorts it otherwise.
